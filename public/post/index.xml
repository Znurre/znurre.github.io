&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-21&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 21&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up by the alarm this morning, which we had set for 10 as we had booked the yukata rental for 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent even more time than usual on my makeup this morning, as I wanted to look the best I could. Today was a very special day for me afterall. I have always looked up to all the beautiful japanese women wearing yukata, and today I would get to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the preparations, we headed to 7eleven as usual for our breakfast. I also made sure to go to the toilet, as I was unsure how easy it would be to go to toilet once I was wearing the yukata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approached the rental store, I was filled with anticipation and nervosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store manager was very friendly, and spoke at least a bit of english. We got to choose the patterns we wanted, both for the actual yukata and the obi, and then she and her assistant helped us put on the yukata. She also put up my hair in a very cute style, with flower ornaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt this pretty before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/yukata.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me in yukata&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When walking outside the store, I was very anxious about what people would think. While yukata is quite a common sight in these areas of Tokyo, it&amp;rsquo;s not all that common to see foreigners wear them, and especially not someone as tall as me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to go to our hotel room first, getting the camera and our umbrellas among other things, and the first thing that happened on our way there was that we had our photograph taken by a man with a camera. We did not get all that many strange looks though, and I was slowly getting more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we both realized early on was how &lt;strong&gt;extremely hard&lt;/strong&gt; it was to walk properly with a gown reaching all the way to your ankles, and the geta sandals on top of that. Our walking speed was severely limited, to the point where we did not dare pass over a road unless the traffic light had just changed to green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to take a stroll in the more touristy parts of Asakusa, the part of Tokyo where we were staying. Not only would we blend in better there, we also figured that we would be able to take some nice pictures with the old buildings as a background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those streets were so full of tourists though that it was hard to pass through properly, even less take a picture with only us in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we decided to go for a walk along the Sumida river flowing through a large part of Tokyo. This path was much less crowded, and we did not meet many people at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this path was not as scenic as one might expect from a path following a river, and it was mostly just concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we quickly realized as well, was how warm the yukata was. Yukata is the cotton variation of the traditional kimono, and is usually worn in the summers as it&amp;rsquo;s much cooler. Even so, compared to my usual attire it was unreasonably hot. The heat together with the difficulty of walking made us take several stops along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/lova_steven_yukata.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lova and Steven wearing yukata&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having walked for what felt like close to an hour, we decided to try and head for a cafe for something to drink. This proved to be more difficult than expected, since the part of Asakusa where we had ended up after our walk was more of a residential area without many shops, restaurants or cafes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven brought up some options using Google Maps on his phone, and we started walking towards one a few km away which was supposed to be open. Unfortunately, we soon realized Google was wrong, as when we got there it was closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started heading in the direction of the more touristy parts of Asakusa with the intention of maybe finding something on the way there. One tricky thing with Google Maps is that it does not list all cafes and restaurants, especially smaller ones, so sometimes the only way of finding a restaurant or cafe is by walking around and looking for signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked in our favor, and we quickly found a small cafe. While the selection of drinks was rather limited, I settled for a mango juice while Steven went for ice tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 3 women in the small cafe, including the owner, and they seemed very friendly with each other. After a while, the store owner asked me where we came from, and we were drawn into quite a long discussion about various things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion started out in japanese, but after half an hour or so, it turned out one of the women spoke perfect english as her man was from the US. After this, the remainder of the discussion was an unhealthy mix of japanese and english :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also became apparent that these 3 women were all related, as one of them was the sister of the store owner, and the last one was her mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/cafe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cafe&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing worth mentioning is that the store owner (left) was 40 years old, while her sister (right back) was past 60, and her mother (right front) was 93 years old! It&amp;rsquo;s quite amazing how young japanese people look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent close to 2 hours at this cafe, and then we started walking back to our hotel where we rested for a bit before returning the yukata to the rental store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/laptop_yukata.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Laptop and yukata&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt so liberating being back to our old clothes again. Being able to walk properly was such a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we had not had anything to eat during the day, we went to Ueno to have a dinner at TGI Friday&amp;rsquo;s. By this time I was so tired of japanese food, so I wanted to avoid it as much as possible. I had a very nice steak, while Steven had a burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the dinner, I had the idea of going to the cinema again, as the previous cinema visit had been such a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the schedule for the same cinema we had been to the previous day, I could see that The Lion King was showing. I had been wanting to see this new adaptation for some time, so it felt like a great opportunity, and so I booked two tickets for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was not too impressed by this movie. It might have been because I have seen the original quite a few times, and this adaptation being so true to the original. I also had a hard time connecting with the characters due to the realistic animal approach used in this new adaptation. It felt more like watching a documentary on Discovery Channel than watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel again, Steven inspected his foot. The geta sandals had not only scraped off parts of his skin, he also found himself with one of the largest blisters I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen between his toes where the string of the geta sandal had been rubbing against his skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/blister.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blisters&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had booked another hotel close to the airport for the next day, meaning we would have to check out at 10 in the morning. As a result, we tried to go to sleep quite early that night, with mixed success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-20&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 20&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up this day without any real plans for the day at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day went by without us doing much. Steven selected a bunch of pictures from the ones we had taken, and we went to Seven Eleven to print them as postcards for him to send to friends and family. We then had lunch at a rather shoddy looking Himalayan restaurant in the hotel vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was mostly spent on the hotel, with me playing Switch and Steven trying to come up with things to write on his postcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the day, I came up with the idea to go to the cinema. Alladin was showing on a nearby cinema with english audio, and I had heard great things about the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore went to the cinema around 6 in the evening, and after some trouble finding the entrance, we made it a few minutes before the movie was to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie was great. Much better than I had anticipated. It was quite long though, slightly over 2 hours, so obviously I was very hungry at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to convince Steven to go to Hard Rock Cafe again. Third time&amp;rsquo;s the charm. This time I did not have a Mango Tango though, as I wanted to be able to sleep :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, I was once again in a very good mood, and Tokyo did not feel so bad afterall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, I booked a yukata rental for the following day. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to try that since a long time, and as mentioned I was very disappointed when we had to cancel our yukata rental plans for Takamatsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to bed happy that night, eager for the next day to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-19&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 19&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we woke up with only one real goal for the day, to go to Akihabara for some geeky shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both me and Steven had things we wanted to buy, and we had predicted this shopping to take most of the day. However, it turned out that Toranoana had pretty much stopped selling doujin CDs, and Melonbooks did not have too much of it either, making my errands come to a quick end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had lunch at Subway in Akihabara, since that has become somewhat of a tradition for me. I was surprised to find that they only accepted cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch and some additional strolling around, we then went back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had a complete mood crash. These 2 weeks have been disastrous for my self esteem, being surrounded by fashionable, good looking, small and slim japanese women all days. I could not help but feel big, clumsy and ugly. I was so tired of Japan, and just wanted to go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few hours at the hotel feeling miserable, and then we went outside again. This time around we went to Kappabashi to look for sushi wares for a friend of mine who is running a sushi restaurant back in Sweden and who had requested me to buy some things for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking around for some time, taking pictures of various sushi wares, we started heading back to our hotel. On the way back, I managed to find a Mountain Dew Violet in a vending machine. I had been wanting to try this for a long time, and so I purchased it and brought it back with me to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/mtn_dew.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mountain Dew Violet&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, it was not all too good, and in the end I did not even drink all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, we went to Hard Rock Cafe in Ueno again to have dinner. I felt like this was one of the few things that could cheer me up, and a good burger and a Mango Tango definitely helped improve my mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having returned from Ueno, we walked out to find a coin laundry to have our last laundry here in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had found a somewhat nearby coin laundry which had also received good ratings on Google, but after our experience there I would have to say I do not agree with them. Our clothes did not get clean at all. Maybe the washing machine was out of detergent, who knows, but the clothes looked just as dirty as before and I had to hand wash my clothes afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a cockroach inside the laundry, making me question the cleanliness of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-18&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 18&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up this day in Osaka, without any plans whatsoever. After thinking about our option for a bit, we came to the conclusion that neither of us had any business in Osaka, and so we decided to head for Tokyo as quick as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the subway to Osaka station, where we made sure to reserve seats for the Shinkansen to Tokyo, and then went to Shin-Osaka station where the Shinkansen departs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased an ekiben to eat on the train, this time in the shape of beef tongue with rice as my previous experience had been so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tutrned out to be quite mediocre in comparison to the real dish, however, which I guess was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing worth mentioning is that these lunch boxes are crazy expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to pay between 1300 and 1500 yen for one, which currently equals 118-135 SEK. Much more expensive than a lunch in Sweden!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train trip was uneventful as usual, but also very tiring. Even the Shinkansen cannot cover the 500 km between these two cities in less than 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Tokyo we first had to find the correct exit from this rather large station, and then walk to a nearby subway station in order to take the Ginza subway to our accomodation in Asakusa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven had been tasked with finding the best way to the hotel, and he said to get off at a stop before Asakusa, as that would be much closer to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking for a little bit, we found the hotel which was located in a shopping street. The receptionists seemed a bit confused when we tried to check in, and asked us for a booking confirmation, which was a first so far. It turned out that we had walked to the wrong hotel again. This time, however, it was the same hotel chain, which apparently had three hotels in the same area. Very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this mistake of ours seemed to be a rather usual occurance, they even had maps prepared for how to get to the other hotel, and after following the map for a few minutes, we reached our destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we had arrived at the correct hotel at least, and the check in went without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room was very small. The smallest room of any hotel we had stayed at so far, but at least the place felt very modern and clean, and it was close to the subway station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After inspecting our room and leaving our luggage, we took the Subway to Ueno, where we visited Hard Rock Cafe for an early dinner. It felt so good eating normal, western food after 2 weeks of only Japanese cousine. This was also the first time in 2 weeks that I held a knife and fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With full stomachs, we headed out for some shopping in the Shibuya and Harajuku area. I went to several second hand clothing stores, and managed to pick up 4 items for a total price below 5000 yen. We had a very fun time too, and Steven helped me out by holding my bags and the clothes I wanted to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After maybe 2 hours or so, the evening finally came to an end with a very weird drink at some cafe in Shibuya. It was tea based, and they had put some weird jelly balls inside it that constantly got stuck in the straw. The evening was warm, and the bustling night life of Tokyo felt great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy when I went to bed that evening, even though it took quite some time before I finally fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-17&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 17&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up around an hour before the alarm, having slept very bad the entire night. Once the alarm had gone off at 8, we started preparing to leave, and then checked out from the ryokan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to buy breakfast at a Familymart store on the other side of the road, and then took a walk to find a place to eat it. A look at the map revealed a nearby park, so we started walking there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like Japan has a thing in general for elevated parks, as this one was yet another elevated park, giving us a great view of the onsen town of Kinosaki while eating our breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/kinosaki3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Breakfast in the park&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/kinosaki2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kinosaki-onsen from above&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing our breakfast, we descended again and started walking towards the station. I ordered a freshly made ekiben at a store near the station, and while waiting for it to be prepared we went to reserve seats for the train we would take to Osaka, where we would spend one night before going back to Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reserved seat tickets we received were completely in japanese, without the usual romanized station names. I am not sure if the guy behind the counter simply forgot to activate it, or if my japanese was good enough that he figured I would not need it. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think it was the latter :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up my ekiben that was now prepared, and we then spent around an hour waiting at the station for our train to leave, which gave me an opportunity to write some more on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train ride to Osaka was quite long but uneventful, and when we reached our hotel it was still too early to check in, as the check in time was from 16:00. It&amp;rsquo;s quite crazy how late the check in times are here in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left our luggage at the hotel and went for an early dinner. Our first attempt was a small cafe just outside the hotel, but as soon as we stepped into the cafe a thick cloud of cigarette smoke made us aware that this place allowed smoking inside, so we quickly stepped outside again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next attempt was the tried and tested place where we had had both dinner and breakfast previously, and this time we had better luck. They seem to be doing business all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both ordered a dish with ginger flavored stir fried pork and vegetables, served with rice of course. It was not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our dinner, the rain had started falling outside, and as we had left our bags at the hotel we did not have any umbrellas with us. We stood and waited for a while, but the rain did not show any sign of stopping soon, and the weather forecast forecasted at least one hour of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we decided to run all the way to the hotel in the rain. By the time we reached the hotel, we were quite drenched in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending some time at the hotel, we decided to go check out a bar that would open at 19:00 in the evening, offering retro games among other things. The walk there was quite far, and we got to see quite a bit of Osaka&amp;rsquo;s night life on our way there. Osaka really has way more of a big city feeling than Tokyo in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached the bar 3 minutes after its opening, so we were the only customers there at the time. I ordered a Mtn Dew, and Steven followed my example. We then went ahead to browse the available games, and tried out a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we went for a Steam powered PC that they had available with a few multiplayer games. I managed to beat Steven quite badly at Puyo Puyo Tetris, but he gave me a real challenge in Towerfall. I won the last match though, which is all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed there for roughly 40 minutes before walking back to the hotel again, this time along the river, which provided some beautiful night sceneries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a hard time falling asleep that night, mostly because of the Mtn Dew, and also because I was hungry as a result of the early dinner we had eaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-16&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 16&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up in Tottori after about 8 hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After preparing ourselves as per usual, we went for breakfast at the nearest 7eleven store, which happened to be located at the train station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we had finished our breakfast, Steven used the toilet of the station, and while I was waiting for him, a guy came up to me and asked how tall I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replied with my length, and we then started talking. It turned out he was a foreigner living in Japan, and was also the currently most well visited Couchsurfing host in Tottori, which I guess explained his extrovert attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven came back and joined in on the conversation as well. After talking for a while, asking about tips of what to do in Tottori among other things, we decided to go with one of his recommendations to visit the sand dunes of Tottori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sand dunes of Tottori are the only sand dunes in Japan, and are therefore a very famous attraction. They even have camels there that you can ride, if you pay of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the to the sand dunes, we had to ride a bus that departed every hour or so, and we had to wait for 30 minutes before the next departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least we got on the bus, and since we had been lining up for it so early, we even got to sit. There were lots of people on the bus, and many did not get a seat. What happened then really surprised me though. I had expected for them to have to stand, but instead they simply flipped down an additional seat in the middle of the walkway, turning the 2+2 seat design into a 5 seat design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus was quite slow, but after 20 minutes or so we arrived at our stop and got off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then took a quick walk on the sand dunes, but even though it was certainly a cool experience having seen the sand dunes, they were not all that interesting. Besides, our shoes were already filled with sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/dunes1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dunes 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/dunes2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dunes 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus back took even more time, and when we finally got back to the station, we were both hungry and decided to go for a lunch. Once again, it happened to be a restaurant where the best option seemed to be hamburg steak, making this the fourth time so far in Japan for Steven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We boarded the train for Hamasaka, where we would change trains for our final destination of the day, Kinosaki-onsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train was a rather ordinary single car diesel train, which slowly made its way towards our target with limited comfort. However, the train we transferred to in Hamasaka was something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still a single car diesel train, the interior was certainly very interesting. Dark wooden details and seats facing the windows like bar stools. The whole interior gave off a very luxerous feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/train1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Train 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/train2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Train 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got off the train just a few stations before Kinosaki-onsen to visit a beach at the sea which we had scouted out beforehand. Unfortunately it was not all that hot outside anymore, only 29°c, which by now feels rather cool after being used to 36°c. Even so, we wanted to use this opportunity to take another swim in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach was very crowded, and the waves were huge. We spent maybe 30 minutes or so there before heading back to the station again to continue to Kinosaki-onsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/waves.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Waves&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arriving to Kinosaki-onsen, we checked in to the ryokan where we would spend the night. The ryokan was located in a very old and traditional house, with lots of stairs and small narrow corridors inside. Our room came with tatami mats, futons and our own private balcony. It was a very nice place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having acquainted us with the ryokan, we headed out for dinner at a chinese restaurant. The food was not as good as the chinese restaurant we had been to the day before, but at least it was okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, after chilling at the hotel for a while, I used the opportunity to take a bath at the private onsen offered by the ryokan. It felt really nice soaking in the hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the evening playing Fire Emblem on my Nintendo Switch, and then went to sleep around 23:00 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Japan 2019: Day 15</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-15&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 15&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning we woke up at 8 by the alarm, as we had decided to stick to our original plan for the remaining days as the typhoon had now left the country without leaving too much devastation behind. We therefore headed towards Tottori by means of a railway passing through the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the train, I sat down at the station to eat a breakfast which consisted of an ekiben with thin fried slices of meat and rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first train was an old, local, 2 car diesel train which we rode all the way to a city called Tsuyama. As the city was located up in the mountains, the air was quite fresh and easy to breathe, and even though the heat was really scorching as usual, the humidity was at least not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our objective here was a museum that Steven wanted to visit, dedicated to the introduction of western science to Japan by means of trade with Holland way back in time, and Tsuyama happened to be the center of that exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk to the museum was quite long, but at least we had the chance to look at the beautiful surroundings in the shape of lush riverbanks and old houses while walking there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/river3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Riverbank&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/tsuyama.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tsuyama 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/tsuyama2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tsuyama 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum turned out to only have text in japanese, and as such it was a bit difficult for me at least to enjoy it. We stayed there for maybe 30 minutes before we started walking back towards the station again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we stopped by a cafe to have lunch. I did not really know what to expect, but from the menu outside I could at least make out 2 possible dishes I could consider eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cafe turned out to be very cosy and nice, combining old with new as the house was old, while the interior felt very modern and bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/cafe1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cafe 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/cafe2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cafe 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down to look at the menu at the table, but could not find the dishes mentioned on the sign. When the waitress came to pick up our orders I inquired about this, and was told that the menu was only for the dinner, and that the dishes available for the lunch were only written on a chalkboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then went on to explain the different options, and I settled for some dish which I understood to be chicken breast fillet of some kind, while Steven went for a curry flavored yakiniku beef meat option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both dishes were to be served with rice, salad and soup, but none of us had expected that we would also be served small onigiri in quite large quantities. I tried my best to eat as much as I could of them before the rest of the food was delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/onigiri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Onigiri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lunch eventually arrived, and it consisted of many small dishes in addition to the primary dish we had both selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/dish1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lova&#39;s dish&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/dish2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Steven&#39;s dish&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t say the food was great, but at least it was good enough, and definitely enough quantity to fill us both up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lunch, we walked back to the train station where we took another local train for our next stop on the way, which would be a small village named Chizu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This village was apparently listed as one of the most beautiful villages of Japan, and Steven had been there before and wanted to have another look at an old temple located in the outskirts of the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train there was only one car, a so called &amp;ldquo;one man&amp;rdquo; train, which felt more like a bus, with the driver handling everything on the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually arrived to Chizu, and had a stroll in the surroundings before finally arriving to the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/temple1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Outside the temple&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this small excursion, we once again went back to the train station to continue our journey for the final stop of the day, which would be a larger coastal town of Honshu named Tottori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having checked in to the hotel, we decided to go have dinner in the restaurant of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner was simple but quite good. I was probably way too tired at this point though, as I kept laughing uncontrollably at everything, including Steven&amp;rsquo;s attempts to pay for the dinner :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to sleep sometime at midnight, which would give us roughly 8 hours of sleep since we had set the alarm at 8 for the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-14&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 14&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very lazy day. We woke up late as we had not set an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I had wanted to try that other dish the previous day, we actually went to the same place where we had our dinner for what could probably best be described as a brunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dish itself was actually really delicious, as I had suspected, but as this place worked by selling food tickets from a vending machine, I did not find a way to order it without noodles on the side. These noodles were cold, thick udon noodles, and were not very delicious at all. I did not manage to eat them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning to the hotel again, I spent some time playing Nintendo Switch, while Steven was not doing much at all. Prior to this, my Nintendo Switch was one of the few parts of my luggage I had regretted bringing with me. Truth to be told, I had not had any time to actually play games. During our train trips, I had mostly been writing on this blog, or looking out the windows at the beautiful landscapes passing by outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the games I had brought with me on this trip was the new Fire Emblem, released just a few days before our trip. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to expect from it, but after having played it I can say that I am hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/switch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lazy switch day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt like a shame spending the whole day on the hotel room playing video games, so after an hour or so we went to Nipponbashi again, where I purchased a few Japanese manga which seemed interesting. We then took the subway to a station close to Osaka Science Museum, which was an attraction I had looked up on the internet and which had received good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum was really crowded, and we had to stand in line for 20 minutes or so before we could purchase tickets. This reflected the number of people inside the museum as well, and all experiments and attractions were occupied by kids and their parents. In addition, most text was only available in japanese, making this excursion quite pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the museum for 30 minutes or so, and then went for a stroll in the surroundings where we looked for a cafe to have something to drink, and if possible, something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really thirsty from the heat, and really wanted to drink a Lemon Squash, which is a drink that is quite common to see in japanese cafes and which is very quenching on a hot summer day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time of walking, we did actually find a cafe, but unfortunately their ingredients for Lemon Squash were sold out and so we had to settle for a &amp;ldquo;mix juice&amp;rdquo;, which was not all that tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not yet had enough of shopping, and so we went shopping around Osaka station, an area that I had been recommended by several websites. We quickly found though that these shops were way outside my comfort zone, being way too elegant and pricy. Most of the shops were the kind where a person stood waiting at the entrance to guide you around the shop, and they generally felt very aimed towards people with shitloads of money and super expensive clothes and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the stores were better in that regard, and especially one store had very nice clothes which I had gladly purchased had they been available in my size :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the mix juice helped quench my thirst for a while, I was still hungry. I had spotted a chinese restaurant in Nipponbash which I was curious about, and so we went there to have our dinner. Unfortunately it was completely full, and so we had to look for other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked back towards our hotel, we looked around for other options, but without any luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back at the hotel, I had a look at Google maps and found two possible candidates in our vicinity. One was a cafe which seemed very cosy, and another was a chinese restaurant. The cafe turned out to be closed, despite the opening times provided by Google stating that they should be opened, so we went looking for the chinese restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chinese restaurant was apparently really popular, and despite being there 10 minutes before the opening, all seats were already reserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was really hungry, and felt like I could eat pretty much anything. We went further and further away from the hotel, and finally found a shopping street with a cafe which seemingly served at least two dishes, both of which I could consider eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon entering, the staff was surprised to see us there, as they would apparently not open for another 10 minutes or so, despite the sign on the door clearly saying &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo;. They were at least kind enough to let us sit down, and offered us water and tissue as is customary here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we inquired about the dishes on the menu, they told us that they were out of rice and therefore could not serve any of them. Just our luck. We walked out from the cafe without having eaten anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disheartened, we kept on walking without any real objective. After walking for a while, I spotted what looked like a chinese restaurant. It looked a bit shoddy, but at this point I was ready to accept almost anything. We went inside and we both ordered the same dish, which was stir fried pork with vegetables and rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course my hunger could have impacted my impression, but damn was it delicious. I would gladly have chinese food over japanese food any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied, we walked back to our hotel where I spent the rest of the evening playing more Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-13&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 13&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 9 or so, without an alarm this time as we did not have a train to catch, nor a check out time to adhere to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My breakfast consisted of melonpan, yoghurt and Coca Cola Energy Cola from 7eleven, same as more or less each morning so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this stay in Osaka was completely unplanned, we did not have any real plans for the day. We therefore ventured out to a part of Osaka known as Nipponbash. This area of Osaka can be compared to Akihabara in Tokyo in that it is centered around Japanese popular culture such as anime, manga, CDs, DVDs, figurines, games and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Toranoana and Melonbooks where I found 4 CDs that I purchased, of which two of them had been on my wish list to buy when going to Japan. We also checked out some other shops, for example an electronics shop where Steven purchased some components for a project he is working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, we went back to the hotel to drop off our purchased goods, and headed back almost in the same direction. The goal was another popular district of Osaka known for its shopping streets. I wanted to buy some clothes among other things as only having one real outfit with me was starting to get tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going shopping though, we made sure to get ourselves some lunch. I had intended to introduce Steven to Ichiran in Tokyo, a restaurant serving delicious tonkotsu ramen. It turned out, however, that they had a restaurant in Osaka as well, so I figured we could as well go check it out while in Osaka instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to queue for maybe 20 minutes or so before getting our seats. The noodles were delicious as always, maybe a bit worse than what I&amp;rsquo;ve had at their restaurant in Tokyo though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some food in our stomachs we then went for one of the largest shopping street in Osaka. We went into some stores, but the problem with being a foreigner in Japan is of course that all of the local brands do not have your sizes. It&amp;rsquo;s always possible to buy items from large fast fashion stores such as H&amp;amp;M, UNIQLO, etc, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really see the point of that as I could as well do it in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I did purchase the new edition of Levi&amp;rsquo;s perfect tee, which I had already intended to purchase since some time ago, but which had not been available in stores in my city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then walked back to the hotel again, where we spent some time before heading off for dinner. A walk in the surroundings did not reveal too many interesting restaurants, so in the end we went for a somewhat generic looking restaurant. Turned out it was part of a chain, but the food was absolutely acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, after having finished my meal, I noticed advertising for another dish I would have loved to try had I known it was available. I set my mind on going back there the next day to order it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typhoon had started showing its signs in Osaka as well, bringing in heavy rain over the city. We used this opportunity to record a greeting for my friend Björn&amp;rsquo;s wedding, which would take place the coming saturday. This trip of ours had unfortunately been planned and decided way ahead of the wedding invitation, which made me unable to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned into yet another late evening, as we did not have to set the alarm for the next day. In a sense, this felt like the first real day of vacation. Although traveling around and doing activities is fun, not having a place to return to every night and spending most of the days going from place to place is quite taxing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-12&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 12&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started with us waking up as usual, preparing ourselves for departure, and then walking towards the station to get on the train for Takamatsu. On the way there, we stopped by a 7eleven store where we had our breakfast for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was raining outside due to the typhoon, and as such, we decided to wait at the station for the train to leave instead of trying our luck at any activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat there for a bit more than an hour, and an interesting detail about this particular train station was an endless loop of piano music played in the background, which gave the station a very sad and eerie kind of feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typhoon that was headed for Japan had more or less entered Shikoku by this point, and we were aware that we might have to expect quite a bit of wind and rain, even in the northern parts of Shikoku where Takamatsu was located. Even so, we carried on with our plans. Anyhow, going north from Kouchi could do no harm, as the typhoon would strike the south of Shikoku first anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the train ride for Takamatsu I received an email from the owner of a yukata rental store I had been in contact with. The idea had been to have both me and Steven rent a yukata, and then wear this for the evening as we had a stroll around in Takamatsu where a festival was being held. This was something I had really been looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to the typhoon, the festival had been cancelled. With the festival being cancelled, and the weather forecast forecasting rain and heavy winds, we felt it was best to cancel our yukata rental plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arriving at Takamatsu station, we had lunch at a restaurant at the train station serving tonkatsu dishes. Tonkatsu is basically fried pork served with rice. I went for a different kind of tonkatsu that was prepared in a garlic sauce, and which was very delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our lunch, we paid close attention to the public announcements made using the stations PA systems. Apparently, due to the typhoon, the last train leaving for Honshu would leave at around 21:00 in the evening the same day, and the next day, all trains would be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our plans for Takamatsu being ruined, and not really feeling like being stuck in a small city with a typhoon raging outside, we decided to cancel our hotel reservation for the night and head for Osaka instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We figured Osaka would be big enough of a city, and far enough from the typhoon to be a good place for staying temporarily until things had settled down. By spending a few days there, we would also be able to survey the damages done by the typhoon and make plans accordingly. As typhoons bring with them heavy rain and wind, it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for them to disrupt public transportation for weeks, and this could have affected our plans for the rest of the trip, not to mention our chances of getting back to Tokyo for our flight home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we got on the first available train for Okayama, where we would change to the Shinkansen for Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train trip to Okayama went well, however the transfer to the Skinkansen did not go as well. We did not have any seat reservations, as this was a completely unplanned event, and as such we could only ride in the cars with unreserved seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly learned that we were not the only people wanting to escape the typhoon. Everything was chaotic, people even skipping lines to get on the trains, something which is very unusual in Japan. At some point, I just gave up trying to get on the train. Me and Steven went to check if there was any possibility of reserving seats on any of the Shinkansen going towards Osaka, but everything was already fully reserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a last resort, we took the Shinkansen in the opposite direction instead. All cars were more or less completely empty, as we were going towards the direction of the typhoon. We then got off at the first station possible, and waited there for the next Shinkansen going towards Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/deserted_station.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Deserted station&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this tactic, we managed to get seats all the way to Osaka. Unfortunately, as the station we had selected was a very small one, we could only board the Kodama Shinkansen which not only stops at every single station, but also waits there for up to 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to Osaka late in the evening, and took the subway to our hotel. After the check in, we went to look for a restaurant to have a late dinner. After having walked just a few minutes, we found a restaurant without a menu outside, but the name contained the kanji for &amp;ldquo;beef&amp;rdquo;, so we figured it could not be too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside, we realized that this was a really fancy place. Steven did not feel all too comfortable. As we soon came to realize, this was a restaurant serving kobe beef that you grilled yourself. Kobe beef is well known to be some of the finest and most expensive meat in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dinner turned out quite expensive, around 400 SEK for me, but it was very delicious. Even Steven enjoyed it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to bed quite late that night as we had decided to stay in Osaka for 3 nights, and therefore would not have to check out in the morning for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-11&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 11&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up quite early the next morning, as the plan was to go up the mountains with an early bus. The idea was to go to an old village, which had been preserved in its original condition, and walk around there while waiting for another bus which would take us to our two primary destinations for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the intended destinations was a village which had more or less been emptied of people, and in their place, an old woman had made dolls and populated the village with them. The second intended destination was two vine bridges up in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there was a typhoon coming from the sea towards our current location, we were a bit unsure of whether it would be safe to carry out the plans. Typhoons usually bring with them heavy winds and rains, disrupting traffic among other things, and we did not want to risk getting stuck in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end we decided that the typhoon was so far away that it would not cause us any problems, and went ahead with the plan as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore took the bus up in the mountains, which was so full of people that we had to stand. Most of them were tourists however, and they all got off at a popular tourist attraction about halfway to our final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road we were going on was full of heavy curves, and it was narrow to the point where only one vehicle could pass in either direction at some stretches. As a result, there were a lot of sudden stops and negotiations between the vehicles of who should keep moving on and who should retreat to make place for the other. Trying to keep myself standing firmly inside the bus was quite a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later we reached our stop and got off the bus. As usual, Steven was the one who had arranged everything, so I did not really know what to expect at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly realized, however, that the old, preserved village was not really a village. It was rather just a few old houses scattered along a mountain side. Having walked all the way up, we were a bit disappointed and quickly descended again. At least we had a good view of the valley down below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/valley.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Valley&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way down, we opted to use the old roads which had existed long before the car roads were built. This provided us with a few interesting views, such as this temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/forest_temple.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Forest template&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using my umbrella to shield myself from the sun, but I found that it was also very effecient for shielding off the huge amount of dragonflies on the roads. Aside from dragonflies, we also saw many lizards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/lizard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lizard&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back down in the valley, we went to the only restaurant available in the area, with was a soba restaurant. Apparently, this area of Japan was famous for its soba noodles, as we could learn from eavesdropping on the conversation by a japanese family who was also eating there at the same time as us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am personally not a big fan of soba, but it was food at least, and compared to other soba I&amp;rsquo;ve had, it was actually quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/soba.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Soba&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to kill time before we could hop on the next bus which would take us to the deserted village. This proved to be hard as there was not much to do or see in the surroundings. The most interesting thing to look at was the river that flowed through the valley. Its water was crystal blue, and the rocks surrounding the river were all tinted blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/blue_river.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blue river&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/blue_rocks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blue rocks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we still had plenty of time to kill, we decided to take a walk to the next bus stop instead, where we would be able to get on the next bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our walk, plenty of cars were passing by, and we frequently had to lean against the mountain wall to give enough space for them to pass by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the bus stop, we sat down and waited for a while before the bus arrived. We had some problems communicating with the bus driver, and as such we ended up skipping our first intended stop. As we passed by the village, we could at least see some of the dolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ths bus stopped at our final destination, the vine bridges, and we got off. There was an admission fee for going down to the bridges which we paid, and then we started descending the wooden stairs down into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly spotted the two vine bridges, but decided to go down to the river flowing beneath first as it was very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/river2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;River beneath the bridges&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From down there, we also got a good view of the two bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/vine_bridge1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vine bridge 1 from below&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/vine_bridge2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vine bridge 2 from below&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked over the smaller of the two bridges and found ourselves at a small campsite, where we also spotted a sign for a forest path which we decided to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest path was absolutely amazing. While there had been plenty of people around the bridges, the forest path was completely devoid of people, and we could walk there in silence and admire the nature surrounding us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/forest_path1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Forest path 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/forest_path2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Forest path 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a good view of the river, as the forest path was parallel to it. At one point, the river turned into a beautiful waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/waterfall1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Waterfall 1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that waterfall was artificial, there were small, natural waterfalls as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/waterfall2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Natural waterfall&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way back, I was stung by some kind of insect. While the bite was very small, it quickly got swollen and red in an area about as big as a fist.  Luckily, there are very few dangerous insects in Japan, so I was not too bothered by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got back to the campsite, we headed for the second bridge which we would use to cross the river and get back up to the bus stop. On the way there though, we spotted a second sign pointing towards &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt; forest path. We did not have much time unfortunately, so we only walked a little bit, but from what I could see, it was just as beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/jungle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jungle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then crossed the bridge and headed back to the bus stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/vine_bridge3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vine bridge ahead&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus arrived before too long, and we used it to get to a small village called Kyojo where we would change to a second bus which would take us back to the train station. While the village was small, we figured we might find something to eat there. All of the other possible bus stops were even more remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a small store in the village, and I went there to buy something small to eat while waiting for the bus which would not leave for another 50 minutes or so. The store owner was very friendly, and recommended me a banana bread, which was shaped as a small banana and contained banana inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to pay with a 10000 yen bill, as that was the only cash I had brough with me. It felt quite silly though, given the small cost of the bread, but the store owner happily accepted it and gave me change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then went to wait at the bus stop for the bus to come. The arrangement was quite strange though, as the only visible sign of a bus stop was on the wrong side of the road. I was worried we would not be able to board the bus from there, so I tried asking an old man who was smoking near the bus stop what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I came to the conclusion that it would be okay to wait at the wrong side of the road, and so we did. When the bus arrived, we waved to it, indicating that we wanted to get on, and the driver gestured to us to get to the other side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure whether it was the right way to do it or not, but at least it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus ride was pretty much the same as our trip the same morning, except we were going the opposite direction, back to the station. At one bus stop, the bus driver suddenly got off the bus, leaving the doors open and the engines on. He then went to take a smoke. It seems like people here are not very conscious about the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the train to Kouchi where we would spend the night. The only reason for that detour was because the hotel availability was good there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the train, I noticed a girl sitting on the other side of the car using a portable DVD player, seemingly watching music videos. I did not know those things even existed anymore. It really felt like a blast from the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having checked in to the hotel in Kouchi, we ventured outside again to look for a place to have dinner. By chance, I walked in to a place called Watamin, which seemed to boast a wide menu. I figured there would at least be something on the menu that would satisfy us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that this restaurant was really cool. They gave us a tablet loaded with an app where we could browse the menu and place orders, similar to Pinchos in Sweden. The big difference was that we did not have to use our own phones, we could use a tablet form factor which was way more suitable, and the waiters came with the food to our table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept was really cool and convenient, the food was unfortunately quite mediocre to say the least. It was not bad by any means, but I was not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This night we spent in separate rooms. All of the twin bed rooms were apparently sold out, and as I did not feel too comfortable sharing a bed, Steven had been kind enough to book separate rooms for us instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt a bit weird sleeping alone after having spent more than a week together, but it was also quite liberating, and I could listen to audio books as I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Japan 2019: Day 10</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-10&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 10&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day started in a rather hectic way, as we were more or less woken up by the old lady telling us to come down to eat breakfast. It turned out we had overslept by more than 30 minutes, and the reason was my phone which had apparently not accepted any charge during the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hurried down to the breakfast, which was &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;. We were served bacon and scrambled eggs, toast, vanilla yoghurt, green salad, potato salad, and an entire cooked fish, among other things. This gave us a good start on the day at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having finished our breakfast, we went back to our rooms to pack our things. I decided to skip makeup, as we wanted to leave as soon as possible, before the heat became too bad. Our goal was to go back the same way we had come the day before, but stop about halfway to take a ferry back to Onomichi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wished to get there before noon, as that is when the heat reaches its peak. I therefore set off at a brisk pace, keen to reach our goal as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Steven was completely out of energy and could not keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped at a vending machine to buy some water and to wait for him. Unfortunately, when I had withdrawed money from the Lawson store the day before, I had only received two 10000 yen bills. Those bills can be compared to 1000 SEK bills, and the vending machines do not accept them. So, even though I had money, I could not actually use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old lady walked past the vending machine, and I asked her if she could possibly change my 10000 yen bill for 1000 yen bills, as I wanted to buy something to drink. She did not have enough change, but she offered to treat me to something to drink. People here in Japan are so nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven came only a few minutes later. He had fallen from his bike and hurt his arm to the point where he was bleeding. We cleaned the wound and used some of the spray we had purchased for our sunburns, since it contained alcohol. I figured it might at least help sterilize the wound a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the trip went well, and we stopped by at a beach near the point where the ferry left from to take a long overdue swim in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/beach.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Beach&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was, by the way, the first time Steven took a swim in 10 years according to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water was cool and soothing, and had it not been for our goal to make it to the ferry before too long, I would have liked to stay there for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven&amp;rsquo;s sunburn kept getting worse despite his attempts to protect it with sunblock. His skin was red, and he had started getting blisters as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/steven_bridge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Steven on the bridge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to the ferry just in time. Had we arrived just 20 minutes later, we would have had to wait for 3 hours. The ferry trip was quick and comfortable, with air conditioning and comfortable seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived to Onomichi, we immediately went to return the bikes, and then took the first train towards our first destination, Okayama, where we would change trains for a small town named Ikeda where we would spend the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train we selected was a Kodama train, the slowest Shinkansen service. It was using an older Shinkansen train type that I had not used before, and it stopped at one station for a full 12 minutes before finally leaving for Okayama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Okayama, we had quite some time to kill before changing trains for Ikeda. We decided to go for lunch, and found a restaurant on a shopping street serving Hamburg steak dishes. We both went for a set menu with chorizo sausages on top of an hamburg steak, served with rice, salad and soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was good, and the place was quite cosy and casual, however the music was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving the place, I used the opportunity to go to the restroom, and found that I had brought with me quite a lot of sand from the beach which was still stuck in my bikini bottoms that I was still wearing underneath my clothes. I wonder what the person in charge of cleaning the toilets will think :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the train to Ikeda, Steven had a moment of panic as he thought he had lost his phone on the station. Luckily we quickly found it on his seat, where it had ended up after sliding out of his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the toilet on the train, and was surprised to find that it was a traditional japanese squat toilet, requiring me to squat over the toilet as the train was twisting and turning. That was quite an experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having arrived at Ikeda, we started walking to our accomodation for the night. We did not know what to expect from it. The ratings on booking.com had not been fantastic, the score being somewhere between 7 and 8. There were also no pictures available, and only very few reviews had been written, leaving us completely in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the place turned out to be quite good. The receptionist was a young guy who spoke decent english, and who was very friendly and easy to chat with. We received the keys to what was more or less our own apartment, with a single room, private bathroom and our own private entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a shower and put on makeup. It felt so good to get rid of the wet bikini I had been wearing underneath my clothes, and to get the stuck salt from the salt water off my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel where we were staying also featured a restaurant and a cafe, and I was in dire need for something cold to drink, so I suggested we go there. The cafe was run by the same guy that helped us check in. It turned out we were a bit early, as the cafe would not be open for another 5 minutes, but he let us sit there while he was preparing its opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both ordered an orange juice, and I ordered a chocolate cake while Steven ordered a chocolate crepe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hipster vibes of the place increased further as the guy proudly told us that the cake was baked with tofu, and therefore was completely vegan. I am not sure whether that was a good thing or not. Personally I did not find it all that good at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was still quite early, we figured we would take a stroll in the surroundings. We were recommended a few places, and went for a temple that seemed to lie in the outskirts of the town. Getting up there was quite a climb, but we got a very good view over the town at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/ikeda1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View over Ikeda&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were to descend again, the sun had already set and we had to walk down in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/ikeda2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Steven in the dark&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was starting to get late, and I was getting hungry again. The map we had received from the guy at the hotel had a list of restaurants, and we tried to decide which one to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one we had first intended to go to was completely full, so we kept walking in search for another one. We found a restaurant which was almost empty, which we later noticed was part of another hotel. Their menu was quite interesting. For instance, they served deer, hunted in a valley close to the town. This was the first time I have seen deer on the menu in a japanese restaurant, so of course I just had to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came in the form of a stew in red wine sauce, served with rice of course, and was quite good. Steven ordered dumplings, which were also quite decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting detail of the restaurant was one table which had 4 JR express train seats instead of normal chairs. Upon asking where they had got them from, I was told that they had been given to this hotel by JR themselves. I later also noticed advertisements inside the JR trains promoting this very hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at our room, we spent quite some time trying to find the air conditioner remote which we had lost somewhere. It took us an unreasonably long time before we found it under one of the beds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to bed after the usual late night chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-9&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 9&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up early in order to take an early train for Onomichi where we would pick up our bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train trip went without any issues, although the train was jam packed full of people and we did not have any seat reservations. I had to stand all the way between Kyoto and Osaka, and had to eat the breakfast I had brought with me while standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to Onomichi station, where the bike rental store was also located. We walked down to the store and I talked to the man at the reception. Apparently, we were in luck, as it was now possible for us to extend the rental time from one day to two days, allowing us to more or less go with the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference, of course, was that we would not be able to leave the bikes on Shikoku for them to be picked up, but instead have to ride them back to the store. We decided to leave that issue for later. In worst case, we could always take a ferry back, bringing the bikes with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a very thorough explanation of security and how to use the bikes, we finally set off for a small ferry that would carry us and the bikes over to the first of the small islands connecting Honshu and Shikoku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/bikes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me and our bikes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bikes were not very good, but at least it was better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ferry did not take long, and before long, we were on the road with our target set on reaching the place where we would stay for the night. This gave us an aproximate distance of about 40 km to cover by bike, which we figured would be quite doable, despite the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a small platform to drink some liquid and to admire the views, which were really fabulous. Green, fluffy mountains, with large beaches and crystal blue waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/rest1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me taking shelter in the shadows&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/shikoku1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/shikoku2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not take too long before I noticed the first problem. My saddle, which had been adjusted by the store staff, had already started to lose height. Before too long, I was sitting in a very uncomfortable position where I could not put enough strength to the pedals, especially during the climbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bikes had not come with any tools, and as such, there was no way for me to adjust it. I tried asking two people on sport bikes whether they had the tools required to adjust it, but their hex keys were too small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads were mostly located along the coast, making them quite flat and easy to ride, but the islands themselves were connected by bridges, and each time we were to use one of them to get to the next island, we had to make a roughly 60m climb with a slope of about 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/bridge1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bridge connecting two islands&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one particularily difficult climb to one of the bridges I started feeling the first signs of a sunstroke, but after some rest in the shadow with a cold drink, things felt better again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/rest2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Steven resting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued the bike trip, climbing to the first bridge. This part of Japan is very friendly for cyclists, and there were designated roads for cyclists to use when ascending to and crossing the bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/bike_road.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bike road&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the road, I found a place with lots of bikes outside. I figured that they might have tools to adjust my saddle height, and luckily they did. I could finally adjust my saddle to a more suitable height, making the rest of the trip so much more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After around 30 km though, the heat started to really get to me again. The heat was really intense, and my body was telling me that this was a really bad idea. This was despite the fact that I had been drinking more liquid than ever before. According to a quick calculation, I must have had at least 3L of liquid during the bike trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to keep going though, as we had no other good options to make it to our accomodation for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/heat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Resting in the heat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not help that both me and Steven were starting to get really bad sunburns. I was wearing a cardigan to cover my shoulders, but I had exposed my arms as to at least keep them a little bit cooler. Steven was using SPF 50++ sunblock, but given how pale he was to begin with, it did not seem to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views continued to be very beautiful though, and especially the view from the bridges were absolutely stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/shikoku3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Views from a bridge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, we managed to make it to the place where we would spend the night. It was an old, run down japanese inn run by an old couple. They only accepted payment in cash, and both me and Steven had to add together our last money to be able to pay, making us more or less broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inn had a very weird feeling. The layout of the place was very weird, and the old lady who ran the place was walking all around as if she was patrolling the place. Our room was very basic, but it had air conditioning at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a dinner option available at the inn, but as we were completely out of money we could not pay for that. Instead, we resorted to the option of buying instant ramen available at the inn for a small sum of money, and sat down in the dining room to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dining room itself was completely empty, and the decoration was very strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of us had much change of clothes as this point, so we did a quick laundry and hung the clothes to dry on our room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, the inn was facing the sea, and we had a very beautiful view outside the windows as the sun was about to set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/sunset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sunset&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the sun had set completely, we dared go outside again as we could now be certain that we would not make our sunburns worse at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/steven_sunburn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Steven&#39;s sunburn&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a walk to a nearby drug store where we bought a spray that was good for curing burns, and then continued to a Lawson store where we both withdrew some more cash as well as buying some light food as neither of us was full from the small instant ramen dinner we had eaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way there, we noticed a large amount of people heading towards the inn with &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of luggage. Judging by their language, they were french, and especially one of girls in the party was wearing &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; revealing clothes that felt more suitable for a photo shoot for a porn magazine than a trip to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back at the inn again, we had a second light dinner at our room compromised of the items we had purchased at Lawson, while we were trying to fend of the french people knocking on our door all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lady at the inn had informed us that the breakfast would be served already at 7 the morning after, so we went to bed quite early to catch enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-8&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 8&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up in Takayama at 9:00 for a change, as we did not have to check out until 11:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used that time to prepare ourselves, and we then went down to the lobby to ask the receptionist for help with booking bikes for the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea all along had been to go by bike over the small islands connecting Honshu with Shikoku, but Steven had missed the fact that reservations for bike rental had to be done far in advance, so the cheaper rental service was already fully booked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another bike rental service as well, which was however a bit trickier to book due to only accepting reservations over phone. Therefore we figured a native japanese speaker should have an easier time doing the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lady at the reception gladly helped us, but unfortunately there was no response, and as such we decided to try again ourselves later, either from a public phone booth or using Skype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having checked out from the hotel, we went to reserve seats for our train rides for the day. This is done at the station buildings, and luckily it was not too far from our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this trip, we have reserved seats a number of times. It&amp;rsquo;s a convenient way of making sure you have a designated seat for a particular train ride. Without a seat reservation, you might have to stand during the entire train ride, which is obviously not too nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular seat reservation was special though. The guy behind the counter who helped us reserve our seats was so insanely fast. We had barely even mentioned where we wanted to go before he had printed the tickets for us. So far, I have never seen this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hotel reservation did not come with breakfast, and we had not yet eaten anything. The time was already past 11 though, so we went for an early lunch instead at a small restaurant on the same street as the hotel we had stayed at. The place seemed to be run by one old man with a passion for cooking, and it was a nice and cosy little place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered a dish with fried chicken in sweet and sour sauce, and Steven went for a spicy ramen. Both our dishes were quite okay, although I found mine to be very strange. The name of the dish was very fitting. It &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; really sweet and sour. The whole dish was drenched in vinegar, and had quite an edge, which I assume came from leek and black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chicken was okay. Still included more skin than I was comfortable with, but at least it was only meat inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the early lunch, we went for a stroll in the city around the older, preserved parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/takayama1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Takayama&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found our way up to a small, elevated park, where we sat down and admired the view of the city roofs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/takayama2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Takayama from above&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heat was still intense as always, and I was trying to cover up my sunburnt shoulders by keeping my cardigan on, which of course made things even warmer. We therefore made our way down to the city again, and sat down on a bench in the shadow outside a small store serving a variety of small dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered a &amp;ldquo;kakigoori&amp;rdquo;, or shaved ice, for both of us. Kakigoori is one of the best ways to survive in the extreme summer heat of Japan, as it&amp;rsquo;s freezing cold and also gives you plenty of liquid, while being tasty at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the kakigoori sold at this store to be a bit pricy, but we soon understood why when we received two &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; bowls of kakigoori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/kakigoori.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kakigoori&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it took us quite some time to eat all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were done, I asked the lady at the store for directions to the nearest public phone booth. It just so happened that it was under a tree on the other side of the road. They apparently still have plenty of public phone booths here in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the phone booth it was scorching hot as the wind could not get inside. I tried to call the number to the bike rental service, but it seemed like they could not hear me. After the second attempt with the same result, I concluded that this phone booth was probably not working as it should, and we instead went for a nearby park in order to make a Skype call from Steven&amp;rsquo;s phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the Skype call, as Steven does not speak very much japanese, and this time around I could speak with the person in the other end properly. Unfortunately, they were also fully booked. We started to feel disheartened, but I was not ready to give up just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some searching, I found out that there was actually a third rental service available. Upon calling them, I was told that they unfortunately did not have any bikes available for our specified dates, but they did give me an advice. There was apparently a newly opened store renting out bikes that most people did not know about. I was told to give them a call to check if maybe they would have any bikes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I therefore placed a third and final Skype call. The person on the other end of the line for this store did not speak a word of english, and as such I was forced to speak japanese, which actually went surprisingly well. I managed to book bikes for the following day, but unfortunately not for two days since they were fully booked for the monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, this felt like a great achievement. This was my first time talking japanese on phone, where you cannot fall back to gestures and body language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that we would only be able to rent the bikes for one day, and that we would have to bring them back to the store as well, we were forced to reconsider our plans a bit. The initial idea had been to go by bike to one of the islands connecting Honshu and Shikoku, where we would stay for the night at a hotel that Steven had booked, and then keep going to Shikoku where we would leave the bikes for them to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Steven booked a hotel on Honshu, in a city near Onomichi where we would pick up the bikes. We figured that we would ride the bikes during the day, return them, and then go to our hotel for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both felt it was quite a shame that we would only be able to ride the bikes for a few hours, and we were also too late to be able to cancel the other hotel reservation for free. Had we went for this change of plans we would have had to pay the full price for the night, which would have been around 1000 SEK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new hotel reservation had very liberal terms, allowing one to cancel their reservation at any time without any fee. Therefore, we decided to wait with cancelling the first hotel reservation since the fee would stay the same anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hoped that maybe when we went to the bike rental service the following day, some other customer might have cancelled their reservation, and in that case we could go for an only slightly modified version of the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was not much more we could do at that moment, so we decided to continue our sightseeing a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/takayama3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me at a shrine entrance&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heat was insane as always, and my neck was burning from the sunburn I had incurred the day before as my cardigan did not cover it. Taking inspiration from the japanese people around me, I put up my umbrella, which is a very usual sight here in Japan even during sunny days since many japanese women use an umbrella to get some cover from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then sat down for a while at a bench in the shadow near the river flowing through the town, and I went down to the river to wet a towel for my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/towel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wetting my towel in the river&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cold water against my neck and shoulders was very soothing, and we stayed at that bench for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed our transport options for the day. and decided to take an earlier train than initially planned as we both felt quite done with Takayama. The initial transport option would have resulted in an arrival time of around 22:00 in the evening to Kyoto where we would be spending the night, and we were both happy to trade an earlier departure time from Takayama for an earlier arrival time in Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we started to approach our new intended departure time, we went to the station again to make new seat reservations and cancel the others, even though we did not have much hope for any seats to be free since were so late with our reservations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ticket office was manned by the same guy as before, and just as before he was insanely quick to make the reservations for us. He managed to find seats for us for both of our trains, and even managed to get us seats next to each other. What a hero :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We boarded the train which would be going for Nagoya, where we would be transferring to Shinkansen for the last distance to Kyoto. Only later did we realize that we could have taken the same train all the way to Kyoto. Apparently this train split in two halves at a certain station, one part going to Nagoya while the other went to Kyoto. The arrival time would have been roughly the same, with the benefit of not having to change trains and wait at the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train for Nagoya was late, which is a very rare occurence in Japan. It was only late by a few minutes though, and we managed to catch our next train without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven had booked a hotel very close to Kyoto station, so the walk there was very short, which I greatly appreciated. I really liked the hotel, which featured small, but very modern and clean rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/kta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kyoto Tower Annex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we were both very hungry, and asked the staff for restaurant recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven had not yet tried Sukiyaki, a dish which Kyoto is very known for, and which is basically thin slices of meat grilled together with vegetables in a boiling soy sauce. I therefore asked for a Sukiyaki restaurant, which the very friendly young receptionist gladly helped us with. He recommended us to go to the top floor of a big shopping mall which was featuring several different restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly found the restaurant, and sat for probably 30 minutes waiting to have a seat since the restaurant was very busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got our table, we got a very basic explanation of how to cook our food, and that rice and vegetables were available as a buffet style service. We were also given quite a large amount of meat to grill. After this, we were left completely alone without any help at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;ve had Sukiyaki previous years there has always been someone keeping an eye on the temperature of the pot, pouring in more sauce and so on, but at this place there was nothing like that. Our sauce got burnt, and everything we tried to grill afterwards tasted like burnt soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the whole thing just felt like a huge waste of money since it was not exactly cheap either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to bed shortly afterwards since we would have to wake up early the morning after.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Japan 2019: Day 7</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;japan-2019-day-7&#34;&gt;Japan 2019: Day 7&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still trying to catch up, which continues to be difficult. Today was another busy day as you will soon get to see :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started off quite early, already at 7:00 as we woke up in good time to make it to the train leaving at around 9:00 without having to rush. With this amount of time available, we intended to also have time for a quick breakfast as well before getting on the train. We therefore purchased breakfast at 7eleven after having checked out from the hotel, and sat down to eat it while waiting for the train to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train trip was uneventful, and we arrived at our destination without issues where we quickly found the right bus. The bus ride was quite long, closer to an hour, but it was very scenic and beautiful as we slowly ascended the mountains on small, winding roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bus took us all the way to our final destination for this day&amp;rsquo;s activity, which was a ropeway used to get up the mountain known as Mt. Tanigawa without having to scale it by foot. The intention was to get up there, look at the view, and maybe take a stroll before descending again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ropeway ride took approximately 10 minutes, and when we got off we were at around 1300 meters above the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/ropeway.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ropeway&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up there, the air was so much easier to breathe, and the landscape was clad in lushy greenery, with people playing and laughing. It was a strange sensation somehow. I felt like I had arrived to paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly realised that we were nowhere near the top. If we wanted to keep going, we had the choice of either scaling the remaining 200 meters or so by foot, or to take a lift up for a sum of money. We decided to pay up and ride the lift up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lift was a regular two seat lift, very similar to the ones used to ascend mountains when skiing. It was my first time riding one, and it was a bit scary. On the way up there, we had our photograph taken by a photographer who thought we were a couple. This photo could later be purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/lift.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The lift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once up there, we spent some time admiring the views which were very epic and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/view1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/view3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View 2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/me_and_steven.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Me and Steven on the mountain top&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then pondered our options for a bit. We had purchased roundtrip tickets for the lift, so we could have descended using that again, but we still had a lot of time and so we decided to take the forest path down instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we had intended to buy some water, but unfortunately everything in all of the available vending machines was sold out, so we had to keep going without replenishing our water reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/path1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Path 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/path2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Path 2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/path3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Path 3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, we reached a sign letting us know that we could either go to the right and return down to the ropeway station landing, or to the left to keep going towards the next mountain top. We chose the latter, and set off towards the next mountain top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest path was absolutely amazing and very well maintained. Lush greenery, oddly shaped rocks and wooden stairs. It provided enough challenge without being too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had decided to leave my backpack down at the ropeway station, but Steven had brought his with him. That meant he had quite a burden to carry compared to me. While I was jumping, sliding and climbing, he was struggling to keep up, and before too long he was very exhausted. The lack of water did not help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one particularily difficult climb we decided to give up and head back to the ropeway station landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/steven_gave_up.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Steven gave up&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/lova_gazing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lova gazing towards the distance&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back at the ropeway station, we made sure to drink a lot of liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/liquid.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Replenishing liquid&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point of interest in the surroundings was the famous train station known as &amp;ldquo;Doai&amp;rdquo;, situated only about 30 minutes walk from the ropeway station. We walked there in the beautiful surroundings and stumbled across a waterfall which we stopped and admired for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/waterfall.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Waterfall&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect from Doai station. Steven had just told me that it was very special, and that it was definitely worth seeing. When we arrived there, I realized how right he was about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the platforms of the station was located underground, hundreds of stairs down. Not only was it a great opportunity to hide from the heat, it was also very magnificent and epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/doai1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Doai station 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/doai2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Doai station 2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/doai3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Doai station 3&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.znurre.com/doai4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Doai station 4&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around this time that I realized I had incurred quite a sunburn on my neck and shoulders. Usually, I&amp;rsquo;d leave my hair free flowing, and tying it up in a bun exposed my neck so much more. I had thought my shoulders would be okay though, given how much of a burn I already had, but apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we later changed trains for our final destination, Takayama, the temperature inside the train was 30°c and my shoulders were burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train ride itself was quite epic though. We were riding the Hida 20, which features very large windows, and the scenery with mountains, rice fields and winding rivers flashing by outside the windows was absolutely stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving the train station in Takayama, we went straight for our hotel. A light rain had just begun, and so I finally got a use for the umbrella I had brought with me. The rain increased in strength and intensity as we were walking to our property, and when we got there it was absolutely pouring down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked in and went to our room, which was a classic japanese twin bed room with tatami mats and futon mattresses, but without bathroom and toilet. These facilities were shared with the rest of the guests. What complicated things a bit for me was that the showers were separate for men and women. Luckily, there were at least private booths, and so I went to shower at the women&amp;rsquo;s showers without any issues, even though it was quite an uncomfortable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt realy good to shower as I had been sweating quite a lot in the intense heat, especially during our forest path excursion in the mountains. Afterwards, I just lay in the room in front of the air conditioner trying to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I did not really feel like going outside again after this. All my clothes were sweaty and dirty, and I did not want to get sticky again, just having showered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven was kind enough to go outside to shop some bread, and so this evening&amp;rsquo;s dinner came to consist of melonpan and green tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started a laundry of our dirty clothes, which in my case included pretty much everything. I even gave up and threw my skirt into the mix, even though it should only be hand washed according to the label. Unfortunately, the laundry could not get rid of some small stains. They are not that noticable though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Steven was out shopping and doing the laundry, I laid out our futon mattress for the night. I personally love futon mattress, as I find them very cosy and comfortable, but Steven was not as big of a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After chatting for quite a while as usual, we went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
