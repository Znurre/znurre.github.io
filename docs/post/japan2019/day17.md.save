# Japan 2019: Day 17

I woke up around and hour before the alarm, having slept very bad the entire night. Once the alarm had gone off at 8, we 
started preparing to leave, and then checked out from the ryokan.

We then went to buy breakfast at a Familymart store on the other side of the road, and then took a walk to find a place to 
eat it. A look at the map revealed a nearby park, so we started walking there.

It seems like Japan has a thing in general for elevated park, as this one was yet another elevated park, giving us a great 
view of the onsen town of Kinosaki while eating our breakfast.

After finishing our breakfast, we descended again and started walking towards the station. I ordered a freshly made ekiben at 
a store near the station, and while waiting for it to be prepared we went to reserve seats for the train we would take to Osaka, where we would spend one night before going back to Tokyo.

The reserved ticket seats we received were completely in japanese, without the usual romanized station names. I am not sure 
if the guy behind the counter simply forgot to activate it, or if my japanese was good enough that he figured I would not 
need it. I'd like to think it was the latter :)

I picked up my ekiben that was now prepared, and we then spent around an hour waiting at the station for our train to leave, 
which gave me an opportunity to write some more on the blog.

The train ride to Osaka was quite long but uneventful, and when we reached our hotel it was still too early to check in, 
as the check in time was from 16:00. It's quite crazy how late the check in times are here in Japan.

We left our luggage at the n and went for a late lunch, or early dinner. Our first attempt was a small cafe just 
outside the hotel, but as soon as we stepped into the cafe a thick cloud of cigarette smoke made us aware that this place 
allowed smoking inside, so we quickly stepped outside again.
