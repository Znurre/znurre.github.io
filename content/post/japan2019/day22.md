# Japan 2019: Day 22

And so we woke up to the last proper day in Tokyo and Japan.

Despite being very tired of Japan by now, it felt quite strange and a bit sad to soon be going back home again.

We did not really have any plans for this last day, so we decided to try our luck at some more shopping for items that I had not managed to get my hands on yet. More specifically, I was interested in CDs by DJ Sharpnel and MOSAIC.WAV.

Our first stop was Akihabara, where I figured I would have best luck. We first went to Toranoana, where I asked a guy working there whether they had any CDs by DJ Sharpnel. After looking at the computer for a while, he finally returned with a negative response. He did, however, give me a map where he circled two other stores which might have the CDs. As always, the service here in Japan is spotless. I then asked him whether they had any MOSAIC.WAV CDs, whereupon he once again turned to the computer.
