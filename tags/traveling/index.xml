      <description>Japan 2019: Day 22 And so we woke up to the last proper day in Tokyo and Japan.
Despite being very tired of Japan by now, it felt quite strange and a bit sad to soon be going back home again.
We did not really have any plans for this last day, so we decided to try our luck at some more shopping for items that I had not managed to get my hands on yet.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 21 We woke up by the alarm this morning, which we had set for 10 as we had booked the yukata rental for 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock.
I spent even more time than usual on my makeup this morning, as I wanted to look the best I could. Today was a very special day for me afterall. I have always looked up to all the beautiful japanese women wearing yukata, and today I would get to be one of them.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 20 We woke up this day without any real plans for the day at all.
The day went by without us doing much. Steven selected a bunch of pictures from the ones we had taken, and we went to Seven Eleven to print them as postcards for him to send to friends and family. We then had lunch at a rather shoddy looking Himalayan restaurant in the hotel vicinity.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 19 Today we woke up with only one real goal for the day, to go to Akihabara for some geeky shopping.
Both me and Steven had things we wanted to buy, and we had predicted this shopping to take most of the day. However, it turned out that Toranoana had pretty much stopped selling doujin CDs, and Melonbooks did not have too much of it either, making my errands come to a quick end.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 18 We woke up this day in Osaka, without any plans whatsoever. After thinking about our option for a bit, we came to the conclusion that neither of us had any business in Osaka, and so we decided to head for Tokyo as quick as possible.
We took the subway to Osaka station, where we made sure to reserve seats for the Shinkansen to Tokyo, and then went to Shin-Osaka station where the Shinkansen departs.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 17 I woke up around an hour before the alarm, having slept very bad the entire night. Once the alarm had gone off at 8, we started preparing to leave, and then checked out from the ryokan.
We went to buy breakfast at a Familymart store on the other side of the road, and then took a walk to find a place to eat it. A look at the map revealed a nearby park, so we started walking there.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 16 We woke up in Tottori after about 8 hours of sleep.
After preparing ourselves as per usual, we went for breakfast at the nearest 7eleven store, which happened to be located at the train station.
When we had finished our breakfast, Steven used the toilet of the station, and while I was waiting for him, a guy came up to me and asked how tall I was.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 15 This morning we woke up at 8 by the alarm, as we had decided to stick to our original plan for the remaining days as the typhoon had now left the country without leaving too much devastation behind. We therefore headed towards Tottori by means of a railway passing through the mountains.
While waiting for the train, I sat down at the station to eat a breakfast which consisted of an ekiben with thin fried slices of meat and rice.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 14 A very lazy day. We woke up late as we had not set an alarm.
As I had wanted to try that other dish the previous day, we actually went to the same place where we had our dinner for what could probably best be described as a brunch.
The dish itself was actually really delicious, as I had suspected, but as this place worked by selling food tickets from a vending machine, I did not find a way to order it without noodles on the side.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 13 We woke up at 9 or so, without an alarm this time as we did not have a train to catch, nor a check out time to adhere to.
My breakfast consisted of melonpan, yoghurt and Coca Cola Energy Cola from 7eleven, same as more or less each morning so far.
As this stay in Osaka was completely unplanned, we did not have any real plans for the day.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 12 The day started with us waking up as usual, preparing ourselves for departure, and then walking towards the station to get on the train for Takamatsu. On the way there, we stopped by a 7eleven store where we had our breakfast for the day.
It was raining outside due to the typhoon, and as such, we decided to wait at the station for the train to leave instead of trying our luck at any activities.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 11 We woke up quite early the next morning, as the plan was to go up the mountains with an early bus. The idea was to go to an old village, which had been preserved in its original condition, and walk around there while waiting for another bus which would take us to our two primary destinations for the day.
One of the intended destinations was a village which had more or less been emptied of people, and in their place, an old woman had made dolls and populated the village with them.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 10 This day started in a rather hectic way, as we were more or less woken up by the old lady telling us to come down to eat breakfast. It turned out we had overslept by more than 30 minutes, and the reason was my phone which had apparently not accepted any charge during the night.
We hurried down to the breakfast, which was huge. We were served bacon and scrambled eggs, toast, vanilla yoghurt, green salad, potato salad, and an entire cooked fish, among other things.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 9 We woke up early in order to take an early train for Onomichi where we would pick up our bikes.
The train trip went without any issues, although the train was jam packed full of people and we did not have any seat reservations. I had to stand all the way between Kyoto and Osaka, and had to eat the breakfast I had brought with me while standing.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 7 Still trying to catch up, which continues to be difficult. Today was another busy day as you will soon get to see :)
The day started off quite early, already at 7:00 as we woke up in good time to make it to the train leaving at around 9:00 without having to rush. With this amount of time available, we intended to also have time for a quick breakfast as well before getting on the train.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 6 Once again a delayed post. Hopefully I will be able to catch up with this one.
We started our day at 8:00, which was the time we had set the alarm for in order to make it in time for the breakfast included in the hotel reservation. The breakfast was very crowded, and the quality of the breakfast was so-so. It worked good enough to fill us up though, and gave us a good start on the day.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 5 Once again, sorry for the late post! I feel like I am falling behind my schedule a bit with these posts, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually surprisingly hard to get the time required to write them, especially during days such as today as you will soon get to see.
We woke up to the alarm we had set at 08:00 and headed straight for the breakfast that was included in the hotel price.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 4 Today I woke up at 7:00 in the morning from the alarm I had set, after having fallen asleep rather quickly at around 22:00 the previous day.
We decided to set the alarm so early since we had a rather daunting task to finish: eat the food provided by the friendly hosts, in the form of a big slice of melon and macha cake, a cake made of japanese green tea.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 3 After having slept some 6 hours or so, I woke up at around 21:00 in the evening. Luckily, I managed to fall asleep again until around 01:00 in the night, providing me with a total of around 9 hours of sleep which I needed badly.
Today&amp;rsquo;s evening might be a bit rough, having woken up so early, but at least it won&amp;rsquo;t be as bad as yesterday.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 2 Sorry for the late update, but this &amp;ldquo;day&amp;rdquo; has been rather intense as you will get to see.
After a night of roughly 6 hours of sleep and a slightly delayed flight from Arlanda to Vantaa in Helsinki, we were just trying to kill time before we could board our flight to Japan at 16:05.
Before that though, we figured we would have something to eat, which also came with the benefit of allowing me to use some leftover Euro from my last trip to Italy.</description>

      <description>Japan 2019: Day 1 Hello everyone. Today marks the start of this year&amp;rsquo;s trip to Japan.
For those of you who are not aware, I am going there yet again, this time for 3 weeks together with a good friend of mine named Steven.
This time around I figured I would do something I usually don&amp;rsquo;t: write a travel log.
It&amp;rsquo;s unusual for me to be away from home for this long, and rather than having to keep everyone at home up to date with whatever is happening here, I found it more convenient to refer anyone who might be interested to this blog instead, where I will post excerpts from our daily adventures along with pictures.</description>
